        <h2>Git command line</h2>
        <p>Figuring out my favourite Git line is very hard because all of them really sounds interesting</p>
        <p>Well my favourite is the grep command.</p>
        <p>The grep command help in searching a file or mulitple files for a particular phrase. 
            After going through a thorough search, it prints out the result out line by line.<br>
            It uses a format of <b>grep "keyword"  Filename</b> </p>
        <p>There are a few arguments or flags that can be combined with the grep command for more efficiency:
            <ol>
                <li> The <b>-i</b> flag: This flags search the keyword in question but it is case insentitive 
                    {Example: grep -i "soon" index.html} </li>
                <li> The <b>-w</b> flag: Find matches for the exact word "Soon" in a file words that contain "Soon," like "Sooner," 
                    won't count {Example: grep -w "soon" index.html}</li>
                <li> The <b>grep</b>: Find matches for "Marvel" in every file in the current folder
                    { Example: grep "Marvel"}</li>
                <li> The <b>-r</b> flag: Find matches for "Marvel" in every file in the current folder AND every subfolder, all the way down
                    { Example: grep -r "Marvel"}</li>
                <li> The <b>-A</b> flag: For each match of "Soon", print out that line AND the 4 lines after it (5 lines total)
                    {Example: grep -A  4 "Soon" famousducks.txt}</li>
                <li> The <b>-B</b> flag: For each match of "Soon", print out that line AND the 4 lines before it (5 lines total)
                    { Example: grep -B  4 "Soon" famousducks.txt}</li>
                <li> The <b>-C</b> flag: For each match of "Soon", print out that line AND the 4 lines before it AND the 4 lines after it (9 lines total)
                    { Example: grep -C  4 "Soon" famousducks.txt}</li>
                <li> The <b>-l</b> flag: Instead of printing out the matching lines themselves, print out the filenames 
                    that match your search {Example grep -l "Daffy"}</li>
                <li> The <b>-n</b> flag: Show line numbers along with the matching lines:
                    {Example: grep -n "Daffy" famousducks.txt}</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
